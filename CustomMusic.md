# Custom music

From version 1.5 onwards you can use external MP3 files for the music in Ambermoon.

To do so, create a folder called "music" next to your Ambermoon.net executable. Then copy your MP3 files to this folder and rename the files 01.mp3, 02.mp3 and so on.

Each file number maps to a specific ingame song. The following list gives an overview.
