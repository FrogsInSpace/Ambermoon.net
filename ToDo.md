## Battle

- Initial scale of dissolve victim has bad anchor behavior if in front row.
- While a monster is hurt and moved (wind spells) it shortly changes the frame index back to normal which looks off


## 3D maps

- 3D monster get easily stuck on wall edges.
- With graphic filter on and fading, elements in front of the 3D view are semi-transparent.
  For example when entering Grandpa's cellar for the first time you can see through the popup.


## UI

- "Do you accept this character?" message is missing in character creator.


## Misc

- If a curse leads to negative stats, they will be huge (negative overflow?).
- Add more savegame slots?
- Teleport cheat can teleport to non-blocking map areas which are "outside" the map borders.
  For example map 344 (Ferrin's forge) has many areas that are considered outside the house.
- Where is the text "CannotCarryAllGold" used?
- Check all unused DataNameProvider texts.
