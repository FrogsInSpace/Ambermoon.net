# Ambermoon.net

Ambermoon.net should become a full C# rewrite of Ambermoon. For the first version the original game data will be used (but not provided). The loader will be able to load ADF disk files or the extracted files like Party_char.amb etc.

Later maybe new data (enhanced textures, etc) may be provided or even the possibility to mod several things.

First focus lies on loading and decrypting data so parts of this project can be used by others to read and understand the original game data as well.

I have also created another github project called [Ambermoon](https://github.com/Pyrdacor/Ambermoon) for providing resources and research the game data. Feel free to have a look or contribute.

Let's bring this game to life on modern PCs with modern resolutions and graphic APIs. :)
